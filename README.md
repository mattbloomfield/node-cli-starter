# Node CLI Starter

## Getting Started

''MUST HAVE NODE.JS INSTALLED''

`git clone` the repository, `cd` into it and `npm install` the module dependencies. 

To see it in action, `npm install -g` while in the directory to install it locally. Run using `node-starter <arg>`.

e.g. 
```bash
$ node-starter test
``` 

## Features

This app is fairly featureless! Use `--help` to see anything it can do. The help is a feature built automatically by the `commander` module. To change the command to run the app, modify the `bin` attribute in `package.json`.
